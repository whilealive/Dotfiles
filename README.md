Dotfiles
================

- dotfiles in folder "all/" represent machine-independent
  preferences.
- other dotfiles contain machine-dependent stuff.
- I manage my dotfiles through an extra folder "~/Dotfiles/" 
  which contains the original files. All dotfiles are
  symlinked to this folder. Makes it possible to handle 
  machine-independent files.
